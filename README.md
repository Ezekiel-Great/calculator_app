## Overview

### The challenge

This project aims to:
- Implement a functional calculator with basic arithmetic operations.
- Ensure the calculator display adapts to different screen sizes.
- Provide multiple themes for user interaction.
- Incorporate animations for component transitions.

This project involves creating a web-based calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations with multiple themes. The calculator ensures the display does not overflow irrespective of the screen resolutions and includes animated transitions for a smooth user experience.
